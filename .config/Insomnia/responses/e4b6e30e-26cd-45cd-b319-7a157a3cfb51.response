on @ericonr 's branch [musl-1.2.0](https://github.com/ericonr/void-packages/tree/musl-1.2.0), which now really is for musl-1.2.1, I found a patch to get `cross-armv7l-linux-musleabihf`

This is because before the `st_atim` etc. there is a `__st_atim32` which is replaced and the `sed` is done without modifying the interesting `st_atim` which follows.\r\n\r\nAn alternative may be to replace `s/st_atim /Atim /` i.e. expect a blank after the type.\r\n\r\n~~Perhaps you @ericonr can update the branch to upstream master once more?\r\nAnd we should integrate this patch with `gcc` and use the `cross-*-musl/files/something.patch` symbolic links to the `gcc/patches/something.patch` style for it.~~ Done.\r\n\r\nI think I could now build all packages for `armv7l-musl` which will take about 2 days.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/void-linux/void-packages/issues/26810","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/void-linux/void-packages","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/void-linux/void-packages/issues/26810/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/void-linux/void-packages/issues/26810/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/void-linux/void-packages/issues/26810/events","html_url":"https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/26810","id":753008495,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI5MTcyODI5","number":26810,"title":"bmake:
