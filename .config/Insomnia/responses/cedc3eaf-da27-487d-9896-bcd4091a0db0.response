Press Tab and Shift+Tab to move the focus between the Buttons and TextInput\r\n3. Observe that pressing Tab when focused on the element before the TextInput or Shift+Tab on the element after the TextInput does not move the focus to the TextInput. Additionally, if you tap to activate the TextInput, you cannot press Tab/Shift+Tab to leave the TextInput.\r\n\r\n## Expected Results\r\nThe TextInput should participate in the keyboard tab order.

Create new react native app using `react-native init MyApp`\r\n2. Add the following in `android/build.gradle`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nallprojects {\r\n  ...\r\n  repositories {\r\n    ...\r\n    // *** ADD ***\r\n    maven {\r\n      url 'https://esri.bintray.com/arcgis'\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n3. Add implementation for ArcGIS in `android/app/build.gradle`\r\n\r\n```\r\ndependencies {\r\n  ...\r\n  // *** ADD ***\r\n  implementation 'com.esri.arcgisruntime:arcgis-android:100.9.0'\r\n```\r\n4. Update the android manifest to indicate the app uses OpenGL 2.0 or above. In `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` add the following:\r\n```\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\r\n<uses-feature android:glEsVersion=\"0x00020000\" android:required=\"true\" />\r\n```\r\n5. Add the following files in `android/app/src/main/java/com/myapp/`: \r\n\r\nESRIMapViewManager.java:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage com.myapp;\r\n\r\nimport android.util.Log;\r\n\r\nimport com.esri.arcgisruntime.mapping.ArcGISMap;\r\nimport com.esri.arcgisruntime.mapping.Basemap;\r\nimport com.esri.arcgisruntime.mapping.view.MapView;\r\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;\r\nimport com.facebook.react.uimanager.SimpleViewManager;\r\nimport com.facebook.react.uimanager.ThemedReactContext;\r\n\r\npublic class ESRIMapViewManager extends SimpleViewManager<MapView> {\r\n    public ESRIMapViewManager(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return \"ESRIMapView\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected MapView createViewInstance(ThemedReactContext reactContext) {\r\n        Log.i(getName(), \"createViewInstance\");\r\n\r\n        MapView mapView = new MapView(reactContext); // TODO: or reactContext?\r\n        createMap(mapView);\r\n        return mapView;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void createMap(MapView mapView) {\r\n        Basemap.Type basemapType = Basemap.Type.STREETS_VECTOR;\r\n        double latitude = 34.0270;\r\n        double longitude = -118.8050;\r\n        int levelOfDetail = 13;\r\n        ArcGISMap map = new ArcGISMap(basemapType, latitude, longitude, levelOfDetail);\r\n        \r\n        mapView.setMap(map);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nESRIMapViewModule.java:\r\n```\r\npackage com.myapp;\r\n\r\nimport android.util.Log;\r\n\r\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;\r\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContextBaseJavaModule;\r\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactMethod;\r\n\r\npublic class ESRIMapViewModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\r\n    private static ReactApplicationContext reactContext;\r\n\r\n    ESRIMapViewModule(ReactApplicationContext context) {\r\n        super(context);\r\n        reactContext = context;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return \"ESRIMapView\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @ReactMethod\r\n    public void boo(String message) {\r\n        Log.i(\"ESRIMapView\", message);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nESRIMapViewPackage.java: \r\n```\r\npackage com.myapp;\r\n\r\nimport com.facebook.react.ReactPackage;\r\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule;\r\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;\r\nimport com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManager;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.Collections;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\n\r\npublic class ESRIMapViewPackage implements ReactPackage {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public List<ViewManager> createViewManagers(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\r\n        List<ViewManager> viewManagers = new ArrayList<>();\r\n        viewManagers.add(new ESRIMapViewManager(reactContext));\r\n        return viewManagers;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public List<NativeModule> createNativeModules(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\r\n        return Collections.emptyList();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Now we create a `ESRIMapView.js` in the root folder with the following content:\r\n```\r\nimport { requireNativeComponent } from \"react-native\";\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = requireNativeComponent(\"ESRIMapView\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Replace `App.js` with the following content: \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport {StyleSheet, View} from 'react-native';\r\nimport ESRIMapView from './ESRIMapView';\r\n\r\nexport default function App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <View style={styles.container}>\r\n      <ESRIMapView\r\n        style={{\r\n          ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,\r\n          height: undefined,\r\n        }}\r\n      />\r\n    </View>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\r\n  container: {\r\n    flex: 1,\r\n    backgroundColor: '#fff',\r\n    alignItems: 'center',\r\n    justifyContent: 'center',\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. If we try to run the project now in Android studio, we get `More than one file was found with OS independent path 'lib/x86/libc++_shared.so'`, so we can add the following to `android/app/build.gradle`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nandroid {\r\n    compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion\r\n\r\n    packagingOptions {\r\n        pickFirst '**/libc++_shared.so' // Also tested merge \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Results\r\nThe app shouldn't crash, but instead show a simple Map. \r\n\r\n## Snack, code example, screenshot, or link to a repository:\r\nhttps://github.com/chichoch/testarcgis <- A repo containing all the changes from the description above.
